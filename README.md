# Pygame-raycaster

A simple raycastermade using pygame and python. It isn't very well optimised, but it was my first try.

Instructions for beginners (after having downloaded the files): 
step 1: Install python 3 and make sure you check "Add Python to PATH" (https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
step 2: Install pygame by opening the command prompt (on windows press the windows button and type "cmd") then type "pip install pygame" and press enter.
step 3 (windows): open the file manager and navigate to the location you saved the files to. In the bar displaying the path to the file, type "cmd" and press enter
step 3 (linux): idk I don't really use linux yet
step 4 (windows): type "python v1.txt" or replace "v1.txt" the version you want to run and press enter
step 4 (linux): type "python3 v1.txt" or replace "v1.txt" the version you want to run and press enter
